# Marco Polo Sample Companion App
## To setup the project
1. git submodule update --init
2. cd hbmx; scripts/setup.sh


This app is expected to be used as a companion to the normal Marco Polo app. You should install the full MP app
from APK (ask a Joya team member for access). Create an account (either with your real phone number, or by long-pressing
the beach ball on the Get Started screen to create a test account) and create some conversations with team members
or other test accounts.

Then from the companion app you can authenticate using this phone number and sync the account.
