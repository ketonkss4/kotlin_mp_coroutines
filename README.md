# Marco Polo Sample Companion App
## To setup the project
1. brew install git-lfs
2. git lfs install
3. git submodule update --init
4. ./gradlew assembleDebug


This app is expected to be used as a companion to the normal Marco Polo app. You should install the full MP app
from APK (ask a Joya team member for access). Create an account (either with your real phone number, or by long-pressing
the beach ball on the Get Started screen to create a test account) and create some conversations with team members
or other test accounts.

Then from the companion app you can authenticate using this phone number and sync the account.
